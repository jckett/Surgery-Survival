# Understanding Surgery Survival Rate Predicors Through Modeling

Understanding how current health conditions could impact survival rates for thoratic surgery is vital for patients. This project uses patients' current health conditions to determine survival rates for thoratic surgery.  

## The Data

The data is available in [UCI's Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Thoracic+Surgery+Data). The attributes it takes into consideration include the patient's current and past health conditions.

## Technologies

Completed in R, the following packages are used
 - caTools
 - foreign
 - ggm
 
# Launch

All code is included in the R Markdown file, and the data file is included in the repository.
